## About The Project

Summer is a minimized AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) and IoC (Inversion of Control) kernel tool library. It provides a set of validators and related utility classes to simplify the validation logic of objects and collections. Additionally, it includes some functions for batch task processing.

### Validation Module

+ Rich Validation Rules: The validation module offers a wide range of validation rules, including length checks, regular expression matching, and 
collection size validations. For example, you can easily validate strings for minimum and maximum lengths, and collections for size ranges.

+ Annotation-Based Validation: Supports annotation-based validation. You can use custom annotations to mark fields in classes and perform 
  validation operations on objects. For instance, use the @NotNull and @Pattern annotations to validate user-defined objects.

+ +Collection Validation: Provides specific validation capabilities for collections. You can set validation rules for the entire collection as well 
  as for each element in the collection.
